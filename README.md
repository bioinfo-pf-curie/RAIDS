*About RAIDs*

The RAIDS project, launched by the Curie Institute in 2013, aims to molecularly characterize cervical cancer (CC) and improve patient risk stratification. As part of the Bio-RAIDS study (NCT02428842), next-gener
ation sequencing was performed on tumor samples (whole-exome sequencing, shallow whole-genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing) identified frequent alterations, including PIK3CA (30%) and prognostic biomarkers like
 TERT, linked to poor progression-free survival. Over 50 clinically targetable mutations were found, offering new therapeutic opportunities. Transcriptomic analysis also linked specific genes and pathways to pro
gnosis and tumor necrosis.
